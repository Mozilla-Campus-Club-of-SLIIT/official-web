## 🌿 Branching and Commit Conventions

### Reference useful guides for branch naming and commit message conventions:

- [Branch naming best practices](https://gist.github.com/jefffederman/1d492f98b8e3913a75ca)
- [Conventional commits guide #1](https://gist.github.com/joshbuchea/6f47e86d2510bce28f8e7f42ae84c716)
- [Conventional commits guide #2](https://gist.github.com/qoomon/5dfcdf8eec66a051ecd85625518cfd13)

### Always create a separate branch for each feature, fix, or documentation change.

- To maintain a clean and conflict-free history, use feature branches instead of committing directly to your main branch. Commits may be squashed during merge operations.

## 🔀 Opening a Pull Request (**PR**)

- PRs should be opened from your fork’s branch → the main branch of the Mozilla Campus Club repository.
- After pushing your branch, click “Compare & pull request” on GitHub.
- Before submitting, confirm:
  - Base repo: `Mozilla Campus Club of SLIIT`
  - Base branch: `main`
  - Head repo: `your fork`
  - Head branch: `your working branch`
- Add a clear PR title and short description.
- For more info, refer to the [GitHub Pull Request Guide](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests).

### Do not combine multiple unrelated changes in one PR.

- Avoid submitting 2–3 issue fixes in the same PR.
- If an issue is too large, divide it into smaller, manageable PRs for easier review.

## ✅ Before Submitting Checklist

- [ ] Code runs locally without errors
- [ ] Code formatted using Prettier (`npm run format`)
- [ ] Branch is up to date with `main`
- [ ] Commit messages follow the conventional format
- [ ] Run `npm run prepare` to ensure pre-commit hooks (linting and formatting) are installed
